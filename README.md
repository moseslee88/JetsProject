# Jets Project
## Second-Week Graded Project
### Moses Lee, Skill Distillery student

This is my week 2 weekend homework project. Key topics this week include:
*Object-Oriented Programming
*Inheritance
*Interfaces
*Polymorphism

I will start by looking over my UML. I started off by choosing to make 3 classes, and a 'Jetprice' subclass that was an extension of the Jets class.  Basically, my program starts by showing a quick menu of options to manipulate a database of Fighter jets. 

I tried to make my main as short and efficient as possible.  I tried this by adding methods that could be invoked from parent classes. For instance, I called 'viewlist' from the Jetprice subclass and 'addjet' method from the Hanger class. 
Since I was aware that arrays can be instantiated by specifying a list of initial values while being aware of the variable types, I created a 'jetsss' array and filled them with values for the jet model, top speed, range of the fighter jet, and its unit price.  Then, I initialized a menu of options for the user.  Afterwards, the user can select any Integer from 1 to 5 to continue along with the program.  In the database, I decided to include a way to convert mph into a Mach number (I did this by googling Mach and discovering that the proportion of 1 Mph is equal to 0.00130332 Mach). I decided to make this menu of options a Do-while loop so that it would keep prompting the user for another choice until he/she exits out and it will go through the code once no matter what. I had a great time overall with this project!

By the way, my official source of research for these Fighter Jets was the website   <<http://top10reviewof.com/top-ten-fighter-jets-world/>>
