# Jets Project
## Second-Week Graded Project
### Moses Lee, Skill Distillery student

This is my week 2 weekend homework project. Key topics this week include:
*Object-Oriented Programming
*Inheritance
*Interfaces
*Polymorphism

I will start by looking over my UML. I started off by choosing to make 3 classes, and a 'Jetprice' subclass that was an extension of the Jets class.  Basically, my program starts by showing a quick menu of options to manipulate a database of Fighter jets. 

I tried to make my main as short and efficient as possible.  I tried this by adding methods that could be invoked from parent classes. For instance, I called 'viewlist' from the Jetprice subclass and 'addjet' method from the Hanger class.
